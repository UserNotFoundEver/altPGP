# hashing_visualization.py
This script generates visualizations for SHA-3 and BLAKE2b hashing.

# SHA-3 Hashing
Generates a SHA-3 hash of a message.
Displays the hash in a subplot.

# BLAKE2b Hashing
Generates a BLAKE2b hash of a message.
Displays the hash in a subplot.

# aes_encryption_visualization.py
This script demonstrates AES-256 encryption with GCM mode and generates a visualization.

# AES-256 Encryption with GCM
Generates a random AES-256 key and nonce.
Encrypts a message using AES-256 in GCM mode, producing a ciphertext and an authentication tag.
Decrypts the ciphertext and verifies the authentication tag.
Displays the ciphertext, authentication tag, and decrypted message in a subplot.

# Experimental
This is all experimental, take with a grain of salt and do your own research.
